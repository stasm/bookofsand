        The Book of Sand


                He told me his book was called the Book of Sand, because 
                neither the book nor the sand has any beginning or end.

                — Jorge Luis Borges, ‘The Book of Sand’

You have come into the possesion of the Book of Sand.  The number of pages in 
the book is no more or less than infinite.  None is the first page, none the 
last.  Every time you leaf through its pages new words appear before your eyes.

What word will it be today?


        Background

The Book of Sand (BoS) is a simple roguelike game.  The player's goal is to 
capture letters until they can use them to spell a whole word.

The Book of Sand is a learning project for me to get more familiar with C.


        Build and Play

Just `make` and run `./bookofsand` in the working directory.


        Influences

The theme of the game is inspired by ‘The Book of Sand,’ a short story by Jorge 
Luis Borges.

The game play has been influenced by Jeff Lait's Letter Hunt [1].  I also 
learned a lot by reading the code of flend's ZigClimb [2] and Jakub 
Wasilewski's A Journey To Hell [3] and Another Visit In Hell [4].  Steven 
Feurst's 512-byte roguelike [5] and the accompanying article [6] were extremely 
helpful in understanding the structure of small roguelikes.  Last but not 
least, Craig Stickel's Beginner's Guide to Roguelikes in C/C++ [7] and 
golergka's c-roguelike [8] helped me structure the code better.
